Bitcoin Dashboard â€” Data Analytics Project
Interactive dashboard visualizing Bitcoin trends, returns, and risk metrics.

Overview

This project analyzes Bitcoinâ€™s performance from 2020 to 2025 using Python, Pandas, and Plotly.
It explores price trends, cumulative returns, and volatility to understand how Bitcoin behaves as a digital asset over time.

The interactive charts make it easy to visualize risk and performance, similar to what an analyst might build for a financial report or investment dashboard.
